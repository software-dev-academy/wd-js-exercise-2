            This is the life story of Dora the Explorer. She went through
            the jungle of programming and found HTML and CSS. However, she met
            figure called Ceano who tells her that those two languages are
            not real programming. Ceano argues that real programming is processing
            data items. Displaying information is the part which is not programming, it is design.
            Dora is not amused with this discussion and decides move further in the jungle of programming.

        some kind of information here. It is really hard to come up with random text to put in
      these kind of documents. That is why you should always use lorem ipsum. I'll use it right now.</p>
